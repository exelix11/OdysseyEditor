## Download
You can download the latest stable build from the releases tab. \
While you can download the alpha and beta versions from [this shared folder](https://mega.nz/#F!MRhBgYTS!M7N6JrWVkH-3pmpmyAgHxg), these versions will have more features but may be unstable, they also don't have auto updates so be sure to periodically check for newer versions. \
**All the releases always include the full editor.**

## Building
This is just the odyssey plugin, to build you need to download an EditorCore commit that matches the version you want to build (aka if you want to build latest odyssey editor, latest EditorCore should work as they're often committed at the same time).

Download this repo, add it to the EditorCore solution and build.
