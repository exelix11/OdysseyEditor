# OdysseyEditor
This is an experimental mario odyssey plugin for [EditorCore](https://github.com/exelix11/EditorCore).
Refer to [EditorCore's readme](https://github.com/exelix11/EditorCore/blob/master/README.md) for the controls and other informations.
The releases include the full editor.

## Building
This is just the odyssey plugin, to build you need to download an EditorCore commit that matches the version you want to build (aka if you want to build latest odyssey editor, latest EditorCore should work).

Download this repo, and symlink it (or just copy it) to the GamePlugins folder of EditorCore, add it to the solution and build.
